## Using ISE With Ansible

In this lab you learn how to use Ansible with Cisco ISE for deployment, configuration, and maintainance. Ansible provides administrators a tool to automate functions and changes rather than manually having to run commands from a command line or pointing-and-clicking their way through an interface.
Objectives

In this Lab you will:

    Learn how to setup and configure your Linux container as a Command Node for Ansible
    Install the Cisco ISE Ansible Collection to automate your ISE deployment.
    Connect to Cisco ISE's ERS API
    Perform queries against the ISE API using Ansible
    Add a new device to your ISE node usning Ansible
    Change settings and apply policy in ISE with Ansible
    Trigger a backup and upgrade of ISE via Ansible

Prerequisites

This lab is designed to be approachable by both those familiar and unfamiliar with using Ansible. We will provide a simple-to-navigate web interface for creating, editing, and running Ansible playbooks. Advanced topics are available and you can take the skills you learn here and apply them to other DevNet labs or to your production networks.

Nice-to-haves for this workshop are:

    An understading of Ansible and Ansible Galaxy.
    Have some familiarity with running commands in Linux.

Beyond this workshop, you will need to have your own ISE deployment with APIs enabled to utilize the Ansible Collection.

You can use a Cisco DevNet Sandbox want to practice in a lab environment.

If you are participating at Cisco Live, we will be using a dedicated DevNet Sandbox for this workshop.
